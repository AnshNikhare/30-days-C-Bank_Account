## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. PIN Hashing with SHA-256 and Salt

- PINs are never stored in plaintext.
- Each PIN is hashed with a unique random salt per account.
- Protects against data breaches and offline attacks.

### 2. Masked PIN Input

- PINs are entered invisibly (masked with `*`) to prevent shoulder surfing.
- Works cross-platform (Windows and Unix-like systems).

### 3. Account Lockout

- After 3 failed PIN attempts, accounts are locked.
- Locked accounts cannot be accessed until unlocked by an admin.
- Prevents brute force PIN guessing.

### 4. Admin-Level Authentication

- Critical actions (update name, delete account) require admin PIN.
- Admin PIN is securely stored hashed with salt.
- Admin PIN setup is prompted on first run.
- Admin authentication adds an extra security layer.
